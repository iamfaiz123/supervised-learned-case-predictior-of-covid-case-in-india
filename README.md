# supervised-learned-case-predictior-of-covid-case-in-india
during covid lockdown , me as a kid does the same thing like every other guy from my college do. Python and ML,
i even took machine learning as an optional subject in my college and i did some maths research about algorithms and thier effeciency 
But i think ML is npt my cup of tea.......................
i don't like python too
